"""Volume II Lab 16: Simplex
<name>
<class>
<date>

Problems 1-6 give instructions on how to build the SimplexSolver class.
The grader will test your class by solving various linear optimization
problems and will only call the constructor and the solve() methods directly.
Write good docstrings for each of your class methods and comment your code.

prob7() will also be tested directly.
