# Problem 2
def water_data():
    '''
    This method should get a JSON file from 
    https://data.lacity.org/resource/v87k-wgde.json
    using the requests library. It should then
    show a scatter plot of the water usage from
    2012 to 2013 organized by latitude and longitude.
    
    Scatter Plot:
    x-axis: longitude
    y-axis: latitude
    point size: water use (hundreds of cubic feet)

# Problem 3
def books_xml():

    This method should include all code used to 
    find:
    - The author of the most expensive book
    - How many books were published before May 1,
    2000
    - Which books reference Microsoft in their 
    description

# Problem 4
    def recycle_bins():

    This method should automatically pull the XML
    file from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/
    views/sxx4-xhzg/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD.
    It should then calculate and return the average
    distance between each bin and its closest 
    neighbor.
