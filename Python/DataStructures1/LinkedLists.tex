\lab{Data Structures I: Linked Lists}{Data Structures I}
\label{lab:Python_DataStructures}

\objective{Analyzing and manipulating data are essential skills in scientific computing.
Storing, retrieving, and rearranging data take time.
As a dataset grows, so does the amount of time it takes to access and analyze it.
To write effecient algorithms involving large data sets, it is therefore essential to be able to design or choose the data structures that are most optimal for a particular problem.
In this lab we begin our study of data structures by constructing a generic linked list, then using it to implement a few common data structures.}

\section*{Introduction}

\emph{Data structures} are specialized objects for organizing data efficiently.
There are many kinds, each with specific strengths and weaknesses, and different applications require different structures for optimal performance.
For example, some data structures take a long time to build, but once built their data are quickly accessible.
Others are built quickly, but are not as efficiently accessible.
These strengths and weaknesses are determined by how the structure is implemented.

Python has several built-in data structure classes, namely \li{list}, \li{set}, \li{dict}, and \li{tuple}.
Being able to use these structures is important, but selecting the correct data structure to begin with is often what makes or breaks a good program.
In this lab we will create a structure that mimics the built-in \li{list} class, but that has a different implementation.
Thus our class will be better than a \li{list} for some tasks, but will also be worse for others.

\subsection*{Nodes}

Think of data as several types of objects that need to be stored in a warehouse.
A \emph{node} is like a standard size box that can hold all the different types of objects.
For example, suppose a particular warehouse stores lamps of various sizes.
Rather than trying to carefully stack lamps of different shapes on top of each other, it is preferable to first put them in boxes of standard size.
Then adding new boxes and retrieving stored ones becomes much easier.
A \emph{data structure} is like the warehouse, which specifies where and how the different boxes are stored.

A node class is usually simple.
The data in the node is stored as an attribute.
Other attributes may be added (or inherited) specific to a particular data structure.
%The data structure class then links the nodes together efficiently.

% Problem 1: Restricting data types on the Node class.
\begin{problem}
Consider the following generic node class.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Node(object):
    """A basic node class for storing data."""
    def __init__(self, data):
        """Store 'data' in the 'value' attribute."""
        self.value = data
\end{lstlisting}
Modify the constructor of the \li{Node} class so that it only accepts data of type \li{int}, \li{long}, \li{float}, or \li{str} (comparable types).
If another type of data is given, raise a \li{TypeError} with an appropriate error message.
Also modify the class docstring to document these restrictions.
\end{problem}

\begin{info}
Often the data stored in a node is actually a \emph{key} value.
The key might be a memory address, a dictionary key, or the index of an array where the true desired information resides.
For simplicity, in this and the following lab we store actual data in node objects, not references to data located elsewhere.
\end{info}

\section*{Linked Lists}

A \emph{linked list} is a data structure that chains nodes together.
Every linked list needs a reference to the first node in the chain, called the \li{head}.
A reference to the last node in the chain, called the \li{tail}, is also often included.
Each node instance in the list stores a piece of data, plus at least one reference to another node in the list.

The nodes of a \emph{singly-linked list} have a single reference to the next node in the list (see Figure \ref{fig:singly_linked}), while the nodes of a \emph{doubly-linked list} have two references: one for the previous node, and one for the next node in the list (see Figure \ref{fig:doubly_linked}).
This allows for a doubly-linked list to be traversed in both directions, whereas a singly-linked list can only be traversed in one direction.

\begin{lstlisting}
class LinkedListNode(Node):
    """A node class for doubly-linked lists. Inherits from the 'Node' class.
    Contains references to the next and previous nodes in the linked list.
    """
    def __init__(self, data):
        """Store 'data' in the 'value' attribute and initialize
        attributes for the next and previous nodes in the list.
        """
        Node.__init__(self, data)       # Use inheritance to set self.value.
        self.<<next>> = None
        self.prev = None
\end{lstlisting}

\label{fig:doubly_linked}
\end{figure}

Now we create a new class, \li{LinkedList}, that will link \li{LinkedListNode} instances together by modifying each node's \li{<<next>>} and \li{prev} attributes.
The list is empty initially, so we assign the \li{head} and \li{tail} attributes the placeholder value \li{None}.

%\subsection*{append()}

We also need a method for adding data to the list.
The \li{append()} makes a new node and adds it to the very end of the list.
There are two cases to consider: appending to an empty list, and appending to a nonempty list.
See Figure \ref{fig:append}.

\begin{lstlisting}

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the 'head' and 'tail' attributes by setting
        them to 'None', since the list is empty initially.
        """
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def append(self, data):
        """Append a new node containing 'data' to the end of the list."""
        # Create a new node to store the input data.
        new_node = LinkedListNode(data)
        if self.head is None:
            # If the list is empty, assign the head and tail attributes to
            # new_node, since it becomes the first and last node in the list.
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            # If the list is not empty, place new_node after the tail.
            self.tail.<<next>> = new_node               # tail --> new_node
            new_node.prev = self.tail               # new_node <-- tail
            # Now the last node in the list is new_node, so reassign the tail.
            self.tail = current_node

\label{fig:append}
\end{figure}

% Warning about 'is' vs '=='.
\begin{warn}
The \li{is} comparison operator is \textbf{not} the same as the \li{==} comparison operator.
While \li{==} checks for numerical equality, \li{is} evaluates whether or not two objects are actually the same (that is, if they are at the same location in memory).

\begin{lstlisting}
# This comparison evaluates to True since the numerical values are the same.
>>> 7 == 7.0
True

# 7 is an int and 7.0 is a float, so they cannot be stored at the same
# location in memory. Therefore 7 'is not' 7.0.
>>> 7 is 7.0
False 
\end{lstlisting}

For numerical comparisons, always use \li{==}.
When comparing to built-in Python constants such as \li{None}, \li{True}, \li{False}, or \li{NotImplemented}, use \li{is} instead.
\end{warn}

\subsection*{find()}

The \li{LinkedList} class only explicitly keeps track of the first and last nodes in the list via the \li{head} and \li{tail} attributes.
To access any other node, we must use each successive node's \li{<<next>>} and \li{prev} attributes.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = LinkedList()
>>> my_list.append(2)
>>> my_list.append(4)
>>> my_list.append(6)

# To access each value, we use the 'head' attribute of the LinkedList
# and the 'next' and 'value' attributes of each node in the list.
>>> my_list.head.value
2
>>> <<my_list.head.next.value>>
4
>>> <<my_list.head.next.next.value>>
6
>>> <<my_list.head.next.next>> is self.tail
True
>>> my_list.tail.prev.prev is self.head
True
\end{lstlisting}

% Problem 2: LinkedList.find()
\begin{problem}
Add a method called \li{find(self, data)} to the \li{LinkedList} class that
returns the first node in the list containing \li{data} (return the actual \li{LinkedListNode} object, not its \li{value}).
If no such node exists, or if the list is empty, raise a \li{ValueError} with an appropriate error message.

Hint: if \li{current} is assigned to one of the nodes the list, what does the following line do?
\begin{lstlisting}
current = current.<<next>>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Magic Methods}

Endowing data structures with magic methods makes it much easier to use it intuitively.
Consider, for example, how a \li{list} responds to built-in functions like \li{len} and \li{print}.
At the bare minimum, we should give our linked list the same functionality.

% Problem 3: __len__() and __str__() for the LinkedList class.
\begin{problem}
Add magic methods to the \li{LinkedList} class so it behaves more like the built-in \li{list} data structure.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the \li{__len__()} method so that the length of a \li{LinkedList} instance is equal to the number of nodes in the list. To accomplish this, add an attribute that tracks the current size of the list. It should be updated every time a node is successfully added or removed.
\item Write the \li{__str__()} method so that when a \li{LinkedList} instance is printed, its output matches that of a Python \li{list}. Entries are separated by a comma and one space, and strings are surrounded by single quotes. Note the difference between the string representations of the following lists:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> num_list = [1, 2, 3]
>>> str_list = ["1", "2", "3"]
>>> print(num_list)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> print(str_list)
<<['1', '2', '3']>>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{remove()}

In addition to adding new nodes to the end of a list, it is also useful to remove nodes and insert new nodes at specified locations.
To delete a node, all references to the node must be removed.
Then Python will automatically delete the object, since there is no way for the user to access it.
Na{\"i}vely, this might be done by finding the previous node to the one being removed, and setting its \li{<<next>>} attribute to \li{None}.

\begin{lstlisting}
class LinkedList(object):
    # ...
    def remove(self, data):
        """Attempt to remove the first node containing 'data'.
        This method incorrectly removes additional nodes.
        """
        # Find the target node and sever the links pointing to it.
        target = self.find(data)
        target.prev.<<next>> = None                     # -/-> target
        target.<<next>>.prev = None                     # target <-/-
\end{lstlisting}

Removing all references to the target node will delete the node (see Figure \ref{fig:remove_bad}).
However, the nodes before and after the target node are no longer linked.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = LinkedList()
>>> for i in xrange(10):
...     my_list.append(i)
...
>>> print(my_list)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> my_list.remove(4)               # Removing a node improperly results in
>>> print(my_list)                  # the rest of the chain being lost.
[0, 1, 2, 3]                        # Should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
\end{lstlisting}

This can be remedied by pointing the previous node's \li{<<next>>} attribute to the node after the deleted node, and similarly changing that node's \li{prev} attribute.
Then there will be no reference to the removed node and it will be deleted, but the chain will still be connected.
See Figure \ref{fig:remove_good}.

\begin{warn}
Python keeps track of the variables in use and automatically deletes a variable if there is no access to it.
In many other languages, leaving a reference to an object without explicitly deleting it could cause a serious memory leak.

\caption{Insertion for Doubly-linked Lists.}
\label{fig:insert}
\end{figure}

% TODO: fix this wording.
% Problem 4: LinkedList.insert()
\begin{problem}
Add a method called \li{insert(self, data, place)} to the \li{LinkedList} class that inserts a new node containing \li{data} immediately before the first node in the list containing \li{place}.
If the list is empty, or there is no node containing \li{place} in the list, raise a \li{ValueError} with an appropriate error message.

See Figure \ref{fig:insert} for an illustration.
Note that since \li{insert} places a new node before an existing node, it is not possible to \li{insert()} at the end of the list or to an empty list.
\end{problem}

\section*{Sorted Lists}

The \li{LinkedList} class is now a fully-functional doubly-linked list\footnote{See the end of the lab for ideas on how to further improve the \li{LinkedList} class.}.
We can use it as the backbone for other basic data structures via inheritance.

% For example, a \emph{sorted list} is a collection elements with a specific ordering.
% When new data is added, the structure judiciously selects the location for the data so that the ordering of the list is preserved.
% Any structure satisfying this property is a sorted list, but our particular implementation will be a linked list.

% Problem 6: SortedList class.
\begin{problem}
Write a \li{SortedList} class that inherits from the \li{LinkedList} class.
This data structure adds new nodes strategically so that the data is always kept in order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a method called \li{add(self, data)} that inserts a new node containing \li{data} before the first node in the list that has a \li{value} that is greater or equal to \li{data} (thereby preserving the ordering).

Hint: use inherited methods when appropriate.
\item Override the \li{insert()} method with the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
def insert(*args, **kwargs):
    raise NotImplementedError("insert() is disabled (use add())")
\end{lstlisting} % TODO: better error message?

This effectively disables \li{insert()} for the \li{SortedList} class, preventing the user from inserting a node in a location that would disrupt the ordering of the data in the list.

\begin{info}
The \li{*args} argument allows the \li{insert()} method to receive any number of positional arguments without raising a \li{TypeError}, and the \li{**kwargs} argument allows it to receive any number of keyword arguments.
This is the most general form of a function signature.
\end{info}

\item Also disable the \li{append()} method.

\end{enumerate}
Outside of the class, write a function called \li{sort_file(infile, outfile)} that reads each line of \li{infile}, adds each line to a \li{SortedList} instance, then writes the lines to \li{outfile} in alphabetical order by iterating through the list.

If the file on the left is \li{infile}, the file on the right should be \li{outfile}.
\begin{lstlisting}
this                            a
<<is                              is>>
a                               this
test                            test
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{warn} % Beware big data
The file \texttt{English.txt} contains over 58,000 English words in random order.
Sorting the entire data set should take about 15 minutes.
Test your data structure on small data sets first.
\end{warn}
\label{prob:sortedlist}
\end{problem}

\begin{info} % Sorting in Python
Python has many quick sorting methods.
Even on the seemingly large data set of over 58,000 words used in the preceding problem, the \li{sort} method for Python lists is almost instantaneous.
In the next lab we turn our attention to \emph{trees}, special kinds of linked lists that allow for much quicker sorting and data retrieval.
\end{info}

\section*{Restricted-Access Lists}
Often it is wise to restrict the user's access to the some of the data within a structure.
The three most common and basic restricted-access structures are stacks, queues, and deques.
Each structure restricts the user's access differently, making them ideal for different situations.
These structures will reappear in many future labs and applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{stack} is a \emph{Last In, First Out} structure (LIFO): only the last item that was inserted can be accessed.
A stack is like a pile of plates: the last plate put on the pile is the first one to be taken off.
Stacks usually have two main methods: \li{push()}, to insert new data, and \li{pop()}, to remove and return the last piece of data inserted.

\item A \emph{queue} (pronounced ``cue'') is a \emph{First In, First Out} structure (FIFO): new nodes are added to the end of the queue, but an existing node can only be removed or accessed if it is at the front of the queue.
A queue is like a line at the bank: the person at the front of the line is served next, while newcomers add themselves to the back of the line.
Queues also usually have a \li{push()} and a \li{pop()} method, but \li{push()} inserts data to the end of the queue while \li{pop()} removes and returns the data at the front of the queue (\li{push()} and \li{pop()} for queues are sometimes called \li{enqueue()} and \li{dequeue()}, respectively).

\item A \emph{deque} (pronounced ``deck'') is a double-ended queue: data can be inserted or removed from either end, but data in the middle is inaccessible.
A deque is like a deck of cards, where only the top and bottom cards are readily accessible.
A deque has two methods for insertion and two for removal, usually called \li{append()}, \li{appendleft()}, \li{pop()}, and \li{popleft()}.

In practice, a deque can also be used as a stack or a queue.
If we restrict our usage to \li{append()} and \li{pop()} (or to \li{appendleft()} and \li{popleft()}), we effectively have a stack.
Similarly, if we are restricted to \li{append()} and \li{popleft()} (or to \li{appendleft()} and \li{pop()}), we effectively have a queue.
\end{itemize}

The \li{collections} module in the Python standard library has a \li{deque} object, implemented as a doubly-linked list.
This is an excellent object to use in practice instead of a Python \li{list} when speed is of the essence and data only needs to be accessed from the ends of the list.

% Problem 7: Deque class.
\begin{problem}
Write a \li{Deque} class that inherits from the \li{LinkedList} class.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use inheritance to implement the \li{appendleft()}, \li{pop()}, and \li{popleft()} methods as described in the preceding section (\li{append()} is already implemented by the \li{LinkedList} class).

The \li{appendleft()} method should accept a single parameter (the data to be added) and return nothing, while \li{pop()} and \li{popleft()} should accept no parameters (except \li{self}) and return a single value (the data removed).

\item Disable all other methods to restrict data access.
\end{enumerate}

Outside of the class, write a function called \li{reverse_file(infile, outfile)} that reads each line of \li{infile}, adds each line to a \li{Deque} instance, then writes the lines to \li{outfile} in reverse order by iterating backward through the deque.

If the file on the left is \li{infile}, the file on the right should be \li{outfile}.
\begin{lstlisting}
this                            test
<<is>>                              a
a                               <<is>>
test                            this
\end{lstlisting}
\end{problem}

\section*{Conclusion}

From problem \ref{prob:sortedlist}, we saw that linked lists are extremely slow at inserting data in the middle of the list.
This is because to get to the place where the new node will go, we have to iterate each time to get there.
However, data at the beginning and end of the list can be accessed instantaneously, making it an ideal implementation for a stack, queue, or deque.

% TODO: Concluding words about the Python list. It is **NOT** implemented as a linked list, so it is a little faster about accessing data. RESEARCH THIS (talk to Robot Scott about it).

\section*{Additional Material}

The \li{LinkedList} class we have built is still somewhat minimal.
Below are some ideas for improving it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add a keyword argument to the constructor so that if an iterable is input, the data is added immediately to the structure.
Python's standard data structures support this feature.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> my_list = list(my_set)
>>> print(my_list)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
\end{lstlisting}
Repeat this for the \li{SortedList} and \li{Deque} classes.
\item Add a method called \li{sort()} that sorts the data of the list inplace.
\item Add a method called \li{reverse()} that reverses the ordering of the data of the list inplace.
\item Implement the \li{__max__()} and \li{__min__()} magic methods for finding the greatest or least element in the list.
\item Implement the \li{__getitem__()} and \li{__setitem__()} magic methods to enable standard bracket indexing.
\item Implement the \li{__iter__()} magic method to support \li{for} loop iteration and the \li{iter()} built-in function.
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{problem}
% (Optional) Write \li{Stack} and \li{Queue} classes that inherit from the \li{Deque} class.
% Add a \li{push()} method and overload the \li{pop()} method in each class to match the behaviors described in the preceding section.
% Disable any other methods.
% \end{problem}
