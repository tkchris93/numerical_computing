\section*{Python}
Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. As an interpreted
language, it can be used interactively.
In the interactive mode, statements will be executed one at a time as they are entered.
This is extremely useful and allows for very rapid programming.
Python is quickly gaining momentum as a fundamental tool in scientific computing because it has the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear, readable syntax
\item Full object orientation
\item Complete memory management (via garbage collection)
\item High-level, dynamic datatypes
\item Extensibility via C
\item Ability to interface with other languages such as R, C, C++, and Fortran
\item Embeddability in applications
\item Portability across many platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX)
\item Open source
\end{itemize}
In addition to these, Python is freely available and can also be freely distributed.

\section*{Installation}
Python 2.7 is required for the labs in this text. We will download everything we need to get started using Anaconda. 
Anaconda is a free Python distribution that includes Python 2.7 and many of the commonly used libraries for scientific computing. 
Most of the libraries we will use in these labs are included in Anaconda. We will add more libraries in the future as needed. 
To download Anaconda, go to \url{http://continuum.io/downloads}, download the installer corresponding to your operating system, and follow the on-screen installation instructions. 
Make sure the installer you use corresponds to Python 2.7. Although later versions of Python are available, they do not yet have many of the features needed for scientific computing. 
For a detailed guide on initial installation, see Appendix \ref{pythoninstall}. 


\section*{Running Python}
Many free IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and text editors are compatible with Python. We recommend you use IPython, which provides three different interfaces: commandline, QTConsole, and Notebook. You can open these interfaces by running \li{ipython}, \li{ipython qtconsole}, or \li{ipython notebook} respectively.
The commandline interface is the simplest of the three, as it merely adds colored syntax to the text in the terminal window.
The QTConsole provides some extra features not available in the commandline interface.
The Notebook interface has the most features and is displayed in a web browser.

Some people prefer to use a text editor and IPython side-by-side. Some of the more popular text editors are described in Appendix A. It will be valuable for you to try a variety of programming environments and configurations until you find what suits you best.

For more information on installing Python and various libraries, see Appendices \ref{pythoninstall} and \ref{updateinstall}.

\section*{Learning Python}
For the remainder of this lab we introduce some basic Python data types and control flow blocks. The text for this lab is intended to tell provide just enough for the reader to be able to create these objects and experiment with them. As you begin your study of Python, we \emph{strongly} suggest you read the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of the Official Python Tutorial \\
        (\url{http://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/introduction.html}).
\item Section 1.2 of the SciPy Lecture Notes\\
        (\url{http://scipy-lectures.github.io/}).
\item PEP8 - Python Style Guide \\
        (\url{http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}).
\end{enumerate}

One useful aspect of the IPython interfaces is \emph{object introspection}, which allows you to see all the methods associated to an object. You can also use a question mark to learn about an object or method.

\begin{lstlisting}
# A pound sign creates a single-line comment.

# To see the methods associated to an object, type the object name followed
#  by a period, and press tab.
In [1]: list.   # press 'tab'
list.append   list.extend   list.insert   list.pop      list.reverse  
list.count    list.index    list.mro      list.remove   list.sort

# To learn more about a specific method, use "?".
In [2]: list.append?
Docstring:  L.append(object) -- append object to end
Type:         method_descriptor
\end{lstlisting}

IPython also has a built-in function \li{help()} that provides interactive help.
If you cannot answer your question using these strategies, search the internet.
In particular, \href{http://stackoverflow.com/}{stackoverflow.com} is often a valuable resource for answering programming questions.

\begin{problem}
Make a simple script that outputs \li{"Hello World"} (this is the traditional first step for programming in a new language).
Create a new file in the text editor of your choice that contains the following line:
\begin{lstlisting}
print "Hello World"
\end{lstlisting}
Save this file as \li{hello.py}.
To execute the file, open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where \li{hello.py} is saved.
There are two main ways to execute a Python script.
To execute the script using the Python distribution, run the following command in your command line:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ python hello.py
\end{lstlisting}
To execute the script using IPython, run the following in the command prompt:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ipython

In [1]: run hello.py    # or simply 'run hello'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{problem}

\section*{Data Types}

% ======================= Numerical Types ======================= %

\subsection*{Numerical Types}
Python has four numerical data types, \li{int}, \li{long}, 
\li{float}, and \li{complex}, each of which stores a certain kind of number.
The built-in function \li{type} identifies the data type of an object.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> type(3)
int

>>> type(3.0)
float
\end{lstlisting}

Python can be used as a calculator. Use \li{**} for exponentiation.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> 3**2 + 2*5
19

>>> 13 % 3
1

# The underscore character is a variable with the value of the previous
# command's output, like the ANS button on many calculators.
>>> 12 * 3
36
>>> _ / 4
9

# Run the following command to gain access to the sqrt function.
# More information on importing modules can be found in Volume II, Lab 1.
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> sqrt(25)
5.0
>>> sqrt(2)
1.4142135623730951
\end{lstlisting}

Python has two types of division: integer and float.
An incredibly common programming mistake is using integer division when float division is appropriate. % TODO: Python 3 fixes this. / is always float division and // is integer division.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> 9 / 3
3
>>> 15 / 4	# Notice the expected result is 3.75
3

# If either the dividend or divisor is a float, float division
# is performed. This can be implemented in two different ways.
>>> 15 / 4.0
3.75
>>> float(15) / 4	# This is an example of type casting.
3.75
\end{lstlisting}

Like all programming languages, Python uses variables to store data.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Use a SINGLE equals sign to create a variable.
# Note that we do not need to specify a data type for the variables.
>>> x = 12
>>> y = 2 * 6

# Type cast to change the default type that Python assigns to the variable.
>>> y = float(y)	# y is now a float instead of an int

# Use a DOUBLE equals sign to check equality of variable values.
>>> x == y  
True

# The 'is' operator checks for object equality. For two variables a and b,
# a 'is' b if and only if a and b refer to the same data at the same location
# in memory. For example, even though x and y have the same numerical value,
# they are not the same object because x is an integer and y is a float, and
# are therefore stored at different locations in memory.
>>> x is y
False                   
\end{lstlisting}

We can also create and manipulate complex numbers.
\begin{lstlisting}
# There are two different ways to create complex numbers.
>>> x = complex(2,3)
>>> y = 2 + 3j	# Note that Python uses the letter j, not i

# Access the real and imaginary parts separately as follows:
>>> x.real
2
>>> x.imag
3
\end{lstlisting}

Comparisons act as expected.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> 3 > 2
True
>>> 6 < 6
False
>>> 6 <= 6
True
\end{lstlisting}

% ====================== Function Definition ====================== %

\subsection*{Function Definition}
To define a function, use the \li{def} keyword followed by the function name, a parenthesized list of formal parameters, and a colon.
Then indent the function body.
Many other languages use the curly braces \{ and \} to delimit blocks, but Python uses whitespace indentation.
This should be done using four spaces.
Many text editors will allow you to set the indentation type to spaces so you can use the Tab key on your keyboard to insert four spaces.

Because Python uses whitespace indentation, the interpreter will assume the code following a function definition to be indented and part of the code block.
If you wish to have an empty code block, use \li{pass} as a placeholder.
\begin{lstlisting}
# No indentation
>>> def add(x, y):
...return x + y
...
IndentationError: expected an indented block

# Correct indentation. The colon denotes the start of the code block.
>>> def add(x, y):
...    return x + y
...

>>> def add(x, y):
...    pass		# do nothing
...

# For multi-line functions, indent all lines that should
# be included in the function.
>>> def mult(x, y):
...    product = x * y
...    return product
...
\end{lstlisting}

We define a function with \emph{parameters} and call it with \emph{arguments}. In the example below, \li{width} and \li{height} are parameters for the function \li{area}. The values \li{2} and \li{5} are the arguments that we pass when calling the function. In practice, the terms \emph{parameter} and \emph{argument} are often used interchangeably.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Compute the area of a rectangle
>>> def area(width, height):
...     return width*height
...         
>>> area(2, 5)
10
\end{lstlisting}

It is also possible to specify default values for formal parameters.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def fn(a, b, c=0):
...    print a, b, c
\end{lstlisting} % TODO Python 3 changes the print statement
The function \li{fn} has three formal parameters, and the value of \li{c} defaults to 0.
We can pass arguments to \li{fn} based on position (positional arguments) or name (named arguments or keyword arguments). We must define positional arguments before keyword arguments (\li{a} and \li{b} must come before \li{c} in the function definition).
\begin{lstlisting}
# Call fn with 2 positional arguments (c=0 by default)
>>> fn(1, 2)
1 2 0

# Call fn with 3 positional arguments
>>> fn(4, 5, 6)
4 5 6

# Call fn with 1 positional argument and 2 named arguments
>>> fn(1, c=2, b=3)
1 3 2
\end{lstlisting}

%The final example demonstrates the flexibility of Python but is somewhat confusing. Whenever possible, you should pass arguments to a function in the order they are defined in the function. Thus, do the following.
%\begin{lstlisting}
%# Call fn with 1 positional argument and 2 named arguments
%>>> fn(1, b=3, c=2)
%1 3 2
%\end{lstlisting}

There is a big difference between the two functions \li{area} and \li{fn} defined above: \li{area} ends with a \li{return} statement but \li{fn} only has a \li{print} statement.
The \li{print} statement does nothing more than display the value of a given object (or objects) in the terminal.
If you have any intention of using the results of a function, always use a \li{return} statement.
The value can then be stored in a variable for later use.

The most general form of a function definition is as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
def fn(*args, **kwargs):
\end{lstlisting}
This means that ``\li{fn} accepts arguments and keyword arguments.''
The arguments, \li{args}, are stored as a tuple; the keyword arguments, \li{kwargs}, are stored as a dictionary.
Such functions can accept any number of arguments and keyword arguments.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def fn(*args, **kwargs):
...     print "Positional: ", args
...     print "Keyword: ", kwargs
...     
>>> fn("Hello", 2, 1, apples = 3, oranges = 2)
Positional: ('Hello', 2, 1)
Keyword: {'apples': 3, 'oranges': 2}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Download \li{spec.py} and save it as \li{solutions.py}.
In this file, implement the \li{sphere_volume} function.
Accept a parameter \li{r} and return the volume of a sphere of radius \li{r}.
For now, use $\pi=3.14159$.
\end{problem}

% =========================== Strings =========================== %

\subsection*{Strings}
A Python \li{string} can be created with either single or double quotes.
They can be concatenated with the \li{+} operator.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> str1 = "Hello"
>>> str2 = 'World'
>>> my_string = str1 + " " + str2 + "!"
>>> my_string
'Hello World!'

# Count the number of characters in a string
>>> len(my_string)
12

# Type cast a number to a string using str()
>>> str(5)
'5'
\end{lstlisting}

We can access single characters of strings using brackets and a range of characters using \emph{slicing}, indicated by square brackets \li{[ ]} after the variable name.
Slicing syntax is \li{[start:stop:step]}.
The parameters \li{start} and \li{stop} default to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
The parameter \li{step} defaults to 1.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Indexing begins at 0 and negative numbers count backward from the end.
>>> my_string[4]
'o'
>>> my_string[-1]
'!'

# Slice the first 5 characters.  The syntax here means start at the beginning
# and go up to (BUT NOT INCLUDING) the 5th character.
>>> my_string[:5]
'Hello'

# Slice from the 6th character to the end.
>>> my_string[6:]
'World!'

# Slice between the 3rd and 8th characters.
>>> my_string[3:8]
'lo Wo'

# Pick out every other character in a string.
>>> my_string[::2]	# string[start:stop:step]
'HloWrd'
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Complete the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the \li{first_half} function. Accept a parameter \li{my_string} and return the first half of \li{my_string}.
\item Implement the \li{reverse} function. Accept a parameter \li{my_string} and reverse the characters in \li{my_string} using slicing.
Return the reversed string.
(Hint: The \li{step} parameter used in slicing can be negative.)
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

% =========================== Lists =========================== %

\subsection*{Lists}
A Python \li{list} is created by enclosing comma-separated values with square brackets. Entries of a \li{list} do not have to be of the same type. You can access a single entry of a \li{list} or a range of entries with the same indexing or slicing operations we used on strings. 
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = ["Remi", 21, "08/06", 1993]
>>> my_list
['Remi', 21, '08/06', 1993]
>>> my_list[0]
'Remi'
>>> my_list[-2]
'08/06'
>>> my_list[:2]
['Remi', 21]
\end{lstlisting}

Common methods of the \li{list} data type include \li{append}, \li{insert}, \li{remove}, and \li{pop}.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = [1, 2]
>>> my_list.append(4)
>>> my_list.insert(2, 3)	# insert(index, value)
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> my_list.remove(3)       # remove(value)
>>> my_list.pop()           # remove and return last value in my_list
4
>>> my_list
[1, 2]
\end{lstlisting}

Slicing is also very useful for replacing values in a list.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[3:] = [9, 10]
[1, 2, 3, 9, 10]
\end{lstlisting}

Python has some built-in functions that are particularly helpful with lists.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> sum(my_list)
15
>>> max(my_list)
5
>>> min(my_list)
1
\end{lstlisting}

We can quickly check to see if a certain value is in a list using the \li{in} operator.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 2 in my_list
True
>>> 6 in my_list
False
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Start with the list \li{my_list = ["ant", "baboon", "cat", "dog"]} and perform the following operations (in order):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Append \li{"elephant"}.
\item Remove \li{"ant"}.
\item Remove the entry at index 1.
\item Replace the entry at index 2 with \li{"donkey"}.
\item Append \li{"fox"}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

Whenever possible, lists should be created using a \emph{list comprehension}, as demonstrated below.
We explore list comprehensions in more detail after discussing loops.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> [float(n) for n in range(5)]
[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
\end{lstlisting}

% ================= Sets ================= %

\subsection*{Sets}
A Python \li{set} is an unordered collection of distinct objects and can be created from a list (or any iterable object).
Objects can be added to or removed from a set after its creation.
Initialize a set using the keyword \li{set} or by using curly braces.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Initialize some sets. Note that repeats are not added.
>>> library_members = {"Lytle, Josh", "Henriksen, Amelia", "Webb, Jared"}
>>> gym_members = set(["Doe, John", "Doe, John", "Smith, Jane", "Brown, Bob"])
>>> print(gym_members)
set(['Brown, Bob', 'Doe, John', 'Smith, Jane'])

# Delete an object from a set
>>> gym_members.discard("Doe, John");
>>> print(gym_members)
set(['Brown, Bob', 'Smith, Jane'])

# Add an object to a set
>>> gym_members.add("Lytle, Josh")
>>> print(gym_members)
set(['Brown, Bob', 'Lytle, Josh', 'Smith, Jane'])
\end{lstlisting}

Like mathematical sets, a Python \li{set} has operations like union, intersection, 
difference, and symmetric difference.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Set intersection returns a new set object.
>>> set.intersection(gym_members, library_members)
set(['Lytle, Josh'])

# You could also call the method directly from one of the objects.
>>> gym_members.intersection(library_members)
set(['Lytle, Josh'])
\end{lstlisting}

% =================== Dictionaries =================== %

\subsection*{Dictionaries}
Like a \li{set}, a Python \li{dict} (dictionary) is an unordered data type.
A \li{dict} stores \li{key:value} pairs, called \emph{items}.
The values of a dictionary are indexed by its keys.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Initialize a dictionary with curly braces, colons, and commas.
>>> my_dictionary = {"business": 4121, "math": 2061, "visual arts": 7321} 
>>> print(my_dictionary["math"])
2061

# Add a value indexed by 'science' and delete the 'business' keypair.
>>> my_dictionary["science"] = 6284
>>> del my_dictionary["business"]
>>> print(my_dictionary)
{'visual arts': 7321, 'math': 2016, 'science': 6284}

# Display the keys and values
>>> my_dictionary.keys()
['visual arts', 'math', 'science']
>>> my_dictionary.values()
[7321, 2016, 6284]
>>> my_dictionary.has_key("math")
True
\end{lstlisting}

The keys of a dictionary must be \emph{immutable}, which means that they must be objects that cannot be modified after creation. Numerical types and strings are immutable objects. Lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable.

% ================== Control Flow Tools ================== %

\section*{Control Flow Tools}
Control flow blocks control the order in which your code is executed.
Python supports the usual control flow statements 
including \li{if} statements, \li{while} loops and \li{for} loops. 

\subsection*{The If Statement}
An \li{if} statement executes the indented code \emph{if} (and only if) the given condition holds.
The \li{elif} statement is short for ``else if'' and can be used multiple times following an \li{if} statement, or not at all. 
The \li{else} keyword may be used at most once at the end of a series of \li{if}/\li{elif} statements.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> food = "bagel"         
>>> if food == "apple":         # As with functions, the colon denotes
...     print "72 calories"     # the start of the code block.
... elif food == "banana":
...     print "105 calories"
... elif food == "egg":
...     print "102 calories"
... else: 
...     print "calorie count unavailable"
...     
calorie count unavailable
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Implement the \li{pig_latin} function.
Translate an input word into Pig Latin.
Pig Latin takes the first character in a word, moves it to the end, and adds ``ay".
There is a special case if the word starts with a vowel.
In this case, just add ``hay" to the end of the word.
(Hint: use the \li{in} operator to check if the first letter of the word is a vowel.)
\end{problem}

\subsection*{The While Loop}
A \li{while} loop executes an indented block of code \emph{while} the given condition holds. 

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> i = 0
>>> while i < 10:        
...     print(i),            
...     i = i+1
...     
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{info} % TODO: change this for Python 3
In Python 2.7, executing \li{print(x)} prints out the string representation for the object \li{x} and a newline character (\li{\n}).
Subsequent \li{print} statements will therefore display the object on a separate line.

In the above example, the comma in the line \li{print(i),} strips off the default endline character.
Subsequent calls then display the object on same line as previous call.
Try running this example with and without the comma.
\end{info}

There are two additional useful statements to use in loops:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \li{break} statement manually exits the loop, regardless of which iteration the loop is on or if the termination condition is met.
\item The \li{continue} statement skips the current iteration and returns to the top of the loop block if the termination condition is still not met.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> i = 0
>>> while True:
...    print(i),
...    i += 1
...    if i >= 10:
...        break        # exit the loop
...
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

>>> i = 0
>>> while i < 10:
...     i += 1
...     if i % 3 == 0:
...         continue    # skip multiples of 3
...     print(i),
1 2 4 5 7 8 10

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{The For Loop}
A \li{for} loop iterates over the items in any \emph{iterable}.
Iterables include lists, sets, and dictionaries.
There are a few different ways to define a \li{for} loop, with the most common ways demonstrated below.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> for i in range(10):
...    print(i),
...     
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

>>> for i in range(50,100,10):
...    print(i),
...
50 60 70 80 90

# When the iterable is a list and the indices are unimportant,
# we can use this intuitive and useful syntax.
>>> my_list = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]
>>> for entry in my_list:
...    print(entry),
...
red green blue yellow

# When keeping track of indices is important, use this method.
>>> for i in range(len(my_list)):
...    print(my_list[i] + str(i)),
...
red0 green1 blue2 yellow3
\end{lstlisting}

The \li{break} and \li{continue} statements also work in \li{for} loops, but a \li{continue} in a \li{for} loop will automatically increment the index or item, whereas a \li{continue} in a \li{while} loop makes no automatic changes to any variable.

\begin{problem}
Implement the \li{int_to_string} function. Translate a list of integers, each between 1-26, to the corresponding lower-case letter of the alphabet.
So the number 1 becomes `a', 2 becomes `b', and so on.
Implement this function using a dictionary.
\end{problem}

% ==================== Generators ==================== %

\subsection*{Generators}

Suppose we are given a large data set and we need to loop through data as we analyze it.
If we were to use the techniques we have discussed thus far, we would need to add each piece of data to a list before being able to loop through it.
Or perhaps we need to pass this large data set to a function.
Passing the entire list would be very inefficient.
We get around these problem using \emph{generators}.

When we want to produce a generator from a function, we use \li{yield} instead of \li{return}. Because \li{return} only gets called once, all the data that needs to be returned by a function must be processed before the return statement. When using \li{yield}, each piece of data can be processed and returned one at a time.

The important difference is that a generator computes the next value in the sequence and returns it. It never has to store all of the values in the sequence. A good way to think of the distinction between lists and generators is to remember: \emph{Iterators return their values while generators yield their values.}

Python uses the \li{yield} keyword to define a generator. See the following code box for an example of implementation:
% TODO: Modify for Python 3
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def range_generator(start, stop=10, step=1):
...    i = start
...    while i < stop:
...        yield i 
...        i += step
...

>>> three = range_generator(0, 3)
>>> next(three)
0
>>> next(three)
1
>>> next(three)
2

# Generators can be used as iterators in for loops
>>> six = range_generator(3, 6)
>>> for i in six:
...     print i,
...
3 4 5

# We can even make an infinite generator, continuing without termination.
# Clearly, this would not be possible using a list.
>>> def inf_generator():
...    i = 0
...    while True:
...        yield i
...        i += 1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Implement the \li{squares} function.
Accept a parameter \li{n} and create a generator of all squares less than \li{n}.
For example, \li{squares(10)} yields \li{0, 1, 4,} then \li{9}.
\end{problem}

% ==================== List Comprehension ==================== %

\subsection*{Revisiting List Comprehension}
List Comprehension is a powerful, efficient way to build lists.
The code is more concise and also runs faster.
Recall a previous example:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> [float(n) for n in range(5)]
[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Implement the \li{stringify} function.
Accept a list of numbers and convert each entry into a string using list comprehension.
\end{problem}

The following \li{for} loop and list comprehension produce the same list but the list comprehension takes about two-thirds the time to execute.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> loop_output = []
>>> for i in xrange(5):
...    loop_output.append(i**2)
...
>>> list_output = [i**2 for i in xrange(5)]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Implement the \li{alt_harmonic} function.
Recall that the alternating harmonic series (1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ...) converges to ln(2).
Using the first \li{n} terms of this series, approximate ln(2)
Implement your function using list comprehension.
The sum of the first 500,000 terms of this series approximates ln(2) to five decimal places.
\end{problem}
